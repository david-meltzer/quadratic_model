# Quadratic Nets and the Catapult Phase

This repository contains supplementary code for [Catapult Dynamics and Phase Transitions in Quadratic Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07737). All experiments were carried out using PyTorch and Google Colab Pro.


# Summary

The experiments can be found in: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/david-meltzer/quadratic_model/blob/main/catapult.ipynb)

To run the experiments only two functions are required, "full_training_loop" and "produce_plots". The documentation for these two functions can be found in the files [training.py](https://github.com/david-meltzer/quadratic_model/blob/main/training.py) and [plots.py](https://github.com/david-meltzer/quadratic_model/blob/main/plots.py), respectively.
